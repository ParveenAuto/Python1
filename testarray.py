#Que1 take a list with with combination of 10 alaphabet and numbers and print all data one by one starting from 2nd no to second last number
#Solution
# mylist=("a", 3, 5, 6, 9, 90, "g", "r", "p", 7)
# for i in range(1, len(mylist)-1):
#     print(mylist[i])

#Que2 Given two arrays arr1[] and arr2[], the task is to find the number of elements in the union between these two arrays.
#Solution
# arr1=set([1,3,87,98,76])
# arr2=set([67,45,98,87,901,1,0])

# union = arr1.union(arr2)
# intersection=arr1.intersection(arr2)

# print(union)
# print(intersection)

#Que3 Given an array, arr of n integers, and an integer element x, find whether element x is present in the array. Return the index of the first occurrence of x in the array, or -1 if it doesn't exist.
#Solution
number=input("Enter the number")
arr1 =[1,2,3,4]
for x in arr1:
    print(x-1)
